# Convolutional-neural-style-transfer

In the first part, We will implement the algorithm of Leon A. Gatys et al's paper: Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks. It is the baseline of our project. And we make a little change for the baseline code(change verison of some library, more explaination, etc). The core principles of style transfer using convolutional neural networks will also be introduced and explained in the first part.

In the second part, we will implement some improvement of the algorithm in the first part. And we will introduce how we improve the algorithm detailedly.

In the third part, we will implement color preservation of Image style transfer. It can enable us to transfer style but not transfer color, which means the generated image will hold original color of content image. We will explain it detailedly in third part.

In the last part, we will implement arbitrary Style Transfer in Real-time. We will explain it detailedly in last part.
